	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		Hey, my name is Jurij. I'm a workflow optimization fanatic and love customization. Doesn't
		matter what, custom keyboards, custom editors, custom chairs, custom everything.. I just love
		it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently this site is mainly used as a playground for gh actions, deployment scripts, DNS tests
		and so on. In the coming weeks, I'll add some tooling and a CV and whatever else I feel like.
